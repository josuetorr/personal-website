			My name is Josh Torres, I am 27 years old and currently living in Montreal, Canada.	I am passionate by technology, mathematics, physics and business.
			I studied theoretical physics at Condordia university from 2012 to 2014. I later decided to study software engineering at UQAM, and now here I am 
			building my own	website.

			Ever since I learnt about computer programming, I became obsessed with the idea of building things. I found it profoundly captivating the concept of 
			bringing your ideas to life with a couple of thousand to millions of lines of code. I believe that this platform allows me to express myself to my 
			fullest potentiel.

			Lately, I have focused on web development. I learnt <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">nodejs</a> for the backend win conjuction with 
			<a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express.js</a> in order to build RESTful APIs. I learnt the basics	of a JavaScript framework call 
			<a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a> (this website is build using this framework). However, my passion is without a doubt low level programming. I adore
			coding in C and C++. I plan on building some homebrew projects that will be listed on my projects page once their Github page will be up and running.
